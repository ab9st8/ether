If you're reading this, it means the author of the codebase you're browsing
wishes to say to you, **"have an awesome day!"**

It also means that the codebase is licensed under a **public-domain-equivalent
license** and the code is the freest it can be â€” anyone can download it, compile
or install it and be happy with its fruits, but just as well anyone can do
things to the codebase itself, like
* modify it,
* redistribute or sell it without attributing the original author.
* publish it somewhere else under their own name,

Well, the author of this codebase decided that that's all okay, but that if
you're planning on doing any of those things, not just passively using the
codebase or its products, you should read this first.

The author wishes you **consider** this below set of guidelines. You are not
**obliged** to adhere to it, but **heavily encouraged.**

1. If you want to modify the code, especially if you have an idea for an
   improvement, **consider sharing the improvements with others.** That way you
   give everyone access to better software and everyone has an awesome day.
2. If you want to redistribute the code or its built form (e.g. a binary),
   commercially or not, **consider attributing the original author** in some
   form. That way people using your redistribution can find out about the
   author's other projects and maybe find something they like even more, thus
   having an awesome day.
3. If you want to enforce copyright onto the code under your own name without
   attribution to the original author, please **reconsider.** This doesn't make
   anyone's day awesome: it
    * robs the original author of recognition for their hard work,
    * makes your publication's users think you're its original author,
    * makes you feel like you're stealing, even if the original author's license
      choice renders this untrue.


Remember: you are not bound in any way to follow this etiquette. Simply think
about committing to one of the simple favors the author asks of you and making
everyone's day awesome!
